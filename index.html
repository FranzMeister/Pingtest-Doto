      <h1>Welcome to Dota 2 Ping Tester</h1>
      <p>This little site allows you to check the latency of your favourite game!</p>
      <h2>What is a ping tester and how does it benefit me?</h2>
      <p>
        People often complain about <i>lag</i>.
        Lag in reference to video games is just a delay between you and the server.
        Sometimes <i>lag spikes</i> (infuriating prolonged delay that occurs <b>repetitively</b>) are often caused by the gameservers itself,
        by your ISP or your own connection. Most of the times the lag spikes are caused by your own connection because
        you were downloading stuff or someone in your household is using up all the bandwidth that is available.
        <br><br>

        So by doing a ping test you will measure how long it takes (in milliseconds) for a data package to be sent from your
        connection to the receiving end. The less delay you have the better is your ping!

	<h3>What does this website do?</h3>
	  <p>This website allows you to ping the Dota 2 servers from your browser without ever touching the command prompt or terminal. But if you want you can always download the .bat file for easier access. th4t also wrote an Android app that does the same thing! But on an Android platform. How cool is that? The link to the app is above.</p>
